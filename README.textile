h1. Clipper for thumbnails

Clipper uses the QuickLook framework to render png thumbnails of a file.
Consequently this will only work on a Mac running 10.5 or later.

Have been able to render thumbnails of the following types of files
* images (jpg, psd, tiffs)
* movies (m4p)
* office (doc, exl, ppt, pages, numbers, keynote)
* other (ical, vcard)


I'd love to say "tested" but there are no tests at the moment. 
This is my first ever C application and it's currently "a bit rough"

*This certainly is not production ready code*

h2. TODO

Make the parsing of arguments smarter. At the moment it assumes that the first argument will always be the path to the file. 
Passing in -h (for help) means clipper will attempt to create thumbnails of a file '-h' 
Dimensions of the output file is currently hard coded.


h2. Gottachs with Quicklook

If the file has no extension Quicklook has no idea what to do with it. 

h2. Things to note

Quicklook won't create an image larger than the original. When previewing iWork documents, quicklook will return the thumbnail stored inside the document (package) at /QuickLook/Thumbnail.jpg
* In Pages the dimension of this image is 361x512 pixels.
* In Numbers the dimension of this image 310x219 pixels.
