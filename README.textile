h1. Clipper for thumbnails

Clipper uses the QuickLook framework to render png thumbnails of a file.
Consequently this will only work on a Mac running 10.5 or later.

Have been able to render thumbnails of the following types of files
* images (jpg, psd, tiffs)
* movies (m4p)
* office (doc, exl, ppt, pages, numbers, keynote)
* other (ical, vcard)


I'd love to say "tested" but there are no tests at the moment. 
This is my first ever C application and it's currently "a bit rough"

*This certainly is not production ready code*

h2. TODO

Make the parsing of arguments smarter. At the moment it assumes that the first argument will always be the path to the file. 
Passing in -h (for help) means clipper will attempt to create thumbnails of a file '-h' 


h2. Gottachs with Quicklook

If the file has no extension Quicklook has no idea what to do with it. 
Files uploads are stored as tempfiles, which means a couple of things.
* File names are changed to a random string
* File extensions _by default_ are stripped
** We have worked around this, by recreating the tempfile with the extension.

h2. Things to note

Quicklook won't create an image larger than the original. Which is nice.

iWork oddities quicklook will return the thumbnail stored inside the document at /QuickLook/Thumbnail.jpg
* Pages documents will return  which is saved at 361x512 pixels.
* Numbers documents have a limit of 310x219 pixels
