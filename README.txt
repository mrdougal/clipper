Clipper for thumbnails

Clipper uses the QuickLook framework to render png thumbnails of a file.
Consiquently this will only work on a Mac running 10.5 or later.

Have been able to render thumbnails of the following types of files
* images (jpg, psd, tiffs)
* movies (m4p)
* office (doc, exl, ppt, pages, numbers, keynote)
* other (ical, vcard)


I'd love to say "tested" but there are no tests at the moment.
This is my first C application and it's currently "a bit rough"

*This certainly is not production ready code*

TODO

Accept arguments for 
* input files
* output files
* dimension of thumbnail
